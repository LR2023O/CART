                    We are a faith based, non-profit, non-governmental organization founded in 2021 initially as a
                    Community Based Organization (CBO) then later upgraded and registered as a National NGO in
                    June 2023. CART-SS’ primary objective is to empower rural women with the tools, knowledge,
                    and skills that they need to transform their lives, that of their families and communities for a
                    more resilient and sustainable future.</p>

                            hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand,
                            and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before
                            others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven”</i></p>

            <h2>Why women and girls?</h2>
            <p style="width: 70%;align-items: center;margin: auto;"><br>
                Women in South Sudan are economic power-houses. They already play central roles in
                agriculture, child care, informal trade and household management, yet still face disproportionate
                barriers. Main barriers include limited access to capital, poor education, poor access to
                healthcare and disruptive inter-communal conflict affecting agriculture and market access.
                Research shows that when women and girls are empowered within a peaceful environment, the
                ripple effects are far reaching: they reinvest over 80 per cent of their income back into their
                families and communities (compared to 30-40 per cent for men), boosting health, education, and
                rural economies. The World Bank notes that closing gender gaps in socio-economic participation
                could expand global GDP by a factor of up to 40 percent. South Sudan stands to benefit
                significantly due to its young, growing population. <br>
                Targeting women inside South Sudan is not just equitable, it is strategic. They are often the
                backbone of the mainly agro-pastoral economy, producing 60 to 80 percent of food from farmlands
                which they do not own. They also have limited rights to livestock and fixed asset ownership
                and are often excluded from decision making. Empowering them to participate with resources
                like savings and loans, skills training, healthcare support, peace advocacy or market access can
                unlock productivity and transformative innovation. It has been established that women-led
                businesses reinvest profits locally at higher rates, creating jobs and stabilizing communities (ADB
                2022). Moreover, women’s inclusion fosters resilience and peace. Households led by
                economically active women are better equipped to weather crises like climate shocks or intercommunal
                conflict. Women’s leadership in economic development challenges patriarchal norms,
                inspiring broader cultural shifts going forward.</p>

                <h2 id="activities">Our specific intervention areas</h2>
                <p><br>
                We recognize that activities targeting women and girls in community span sectors that have a
                direct and critical bearing on households. Our interventions, while specific, acknowledges the
                convergence between these different intervention themes. CART-SS’ focus is therefore on the
                following areas:
                <ul id="list">
                    <li>Health and Nutrition</li>
                    <li>Protection/Gender Based Violence (GBV)</li>
                    <li>Peace building</li>
                    <li>Food Security and Livelihood (FSL)</li>
                </ul>
                Cross cutting themes like disability inclusion, gender parity and climate resilience are integral to
                all our implementation approaches except where a donor opts out.</p><br>
                <h2>Our approach</h2><br>
                <p>We value partnerships. Our first-line partner are the women themselves. We work with them to
identify what works, set objectives, pin-point mobilizable resources in community, engage
relevant stakeholders then follow through the roadmap together. We believe participatory
approach provides the best mechanism to not only unlock latent capacity but also build into the
process a sense of community ownership and accountability.</p><br>
               <h2>Our geographical scope</h2><br>
               <p>We work within the boundaries of South Sudan. Our intervention scope is broadly determined
by severity of need and vulnerability status of women their families and communities in selected
locations. So far, we have been partners in the implementation of projects in <b>Nothern Bahr El
Ghazal (Aweil North, Aweil East and Awil Center), Jonglei (Akobo, Nyirol, Fangak, Ayod Twic East
and Duk counties) and Upper Nile States (Ulang, Maiwut, Renk, Panyikang, Nasir counties).</b></p>

        <h2 id="more">Our Declaration</h2>
          <p><br>We are inspired by the everlasting Christian message of love. We believe that the world is made
better and safer when we each extend a hand of support and give hope to those who critically
need it.</p>
